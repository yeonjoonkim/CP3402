Project Report

First of all, I have created a Git repository for U3A project to start with the project management. The project management tool was helpful to the time management and tracking the tasks. To achieve the client's goal, I used the site-map to draw the big picture of the objectives and created the tasks on the project management board based on the goal and needed.

I created a local virtual machine to build a Wordpress by using a Scotch Box to use the Vagrant then I committed this to Github. The Scotch Box has a pre-configured Vagrant Box to running the local environment. Github was used for the version control by using the commands.

I choose the google cloud to deploy the local Wordpress to live web hosting server as the most common platform in the world is the google and easily be able to manage the web hosting. In addition, I have used the All In One WP Migration plugin to push the local host to live server which was easily pushed the all contents.  Finally, in order to reuse the child theme that I have created, I did not do hard coding on the theme as the client easily change the styling.

The project was hard for me as the result of the lack of knowledge in relation to the University of Third Age which is related to the old people, and was not used to using the local enviroment to perform the Wordpress as well as the child theme. However, I have learnt how to use the Wordpress by using the local environment, Git commit, transfer from the local to the live server. I would like to learn more about how to manage the servers. In conclusion, I strongly believe that I have just started my journey.
