In this project, I developed a new website for U3A Townsville by using a Wordpress. To achieve the client's need, I decided to create a custom theme called as a U3A rather than using a existing theme. In addition, I am appreciated with the client that gave me the opportunities to explore my existing skills and learn new skills throughout the this project. 

The project was using a modern development tool that the google cloud to deploy the local Wordpress to live web hosting server as the most common platform in the world is the google and easily be able to manage the web hosting. In addition, I have used the All In One WP Migration plugin to push the local host to live server which was easily pushed the all contents.  Finally, in order to reuse the child theme that I have created, I did not do hard coding on the theme as the client easily change the styling. In this project, I had the opportunity to build my design and deployment skills by using Wordpress and Sass to develop the custom theme

I have used a project management tool on the GitHub, and was helpful to the time management and tracking the tasks. In addition, I created a local virtual machine to build a Wordpress by using a Scotch Box to use the Vagrant then I commited the "sytle.css" to the GitHub. The Scotch Box has a pre-configured Vagrant Box to running the local environment. GitHub was used for the version control by using the commands.

The project was hard for me as the result of the lack of knowledge in relation to the University of Third Age, and was not used to using the local environment to perform the Wordpress as well as the child theme. However, I have learnt how to use the Wordpress by using the local environment, Git commit, transfer from the local to the live server. I would like to learn more about how to manage the servers. In conclusion, I strongly believe that I have just started my journey.
